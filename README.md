# Math magicians

> This milestone of this project is all about analyzing the already implemented `calculate.js` and `operate.js` codes and implement event handling for each button of the calculator in the Calculator component, one of the components of the main react project. JavaScript and CSS are used to design the UI of the calculator component. Class-based React event handling using `setState` method is used to implement the event handling.


## Built With
- Languages used: JavaScript, CSS.
- Frameworks used: React.
- Technologies used: VS code editor, Github, Gitflows .babelrc, npm.

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Setup
You have to install npm package manager globally.

### Install
1. Create repository, named here 'math-magicians'.
2. Follow gitflow,i.e., create dev branch and then make it the default one. finally create the
